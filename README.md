# Latex-report-on-Data-Analysis-of-Alzheimer-s-Dataset
Introduction
This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis project focusing on Alzheimer's disease. The aim of this project is to explore the relationship between various characteristics and Alzheimer's diagnosis using data science techniques. The analysis provides valuable insights into potential early detection and intervention strategies for this neurodegenerative disorder.

Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis includes diverse attributes related to Alzheimer's disease, such as gender, age, education, socioeconomic status, cognitive scores, brain volume, and more. The response variable is the diagnosis group, categorized as Nondemented, Demented, or Other.

Analysis Steps

Data Preprocessing: The initial step involved cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and converting categorical variables for further analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Descriptive statistics and visualizations were used to gain initial insights into the data and understand relationships between different variables.

K-Means Clustering: K-Means clustering was performed to identify distinct groups within the dataset based on similar characteristics.

Logistic Regression Modeling: Logistic regression was employed to assess the association between predictor variables and the diagnosis group. Feature selection techniques helped identify significant predictors.

Results
The analysis revealed interesting insights into the relationship between Alzheimer's disease characteristics and diagnosis. The clustering results identified distinct cognitive impairment groups, and logistic regression highlighted key predictors contributing to dementia diagnosis.
